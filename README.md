In recent years, some deep learning models have been developed for biological pathway analysis and predicting clinical events. However, topological information hidden in pathways is still inaccessible, which limits those modelsâ€™ further application in bioinformatics. To address these issues, we propose a novel model, called PathGNN, which constructs an interpretable graph representation learning model that is able to capture topological information hidden in biological pathways.

The gene expression and clinical datasets download from TCGA (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/); The pathway information download from Reactome database (https://reactome.org/). Then prepare using `data.py`. 

The preprocessed dataset is very large, you can contact us if you need it (liangbilin@pjlab.org.cn or xujie@pjlab.org.cn).

we applied `model.py` to construct PathGNN models for predicting risk stratification of cancer. `.ini` files were profiles for building model.

`submodel.py` is used to realize the `Subnetwork1` in our paper.
